# Topology

- update.py: download some elements (soon better used)
- readMisp.py: convert misp attributes into rules
- check_value: TODO
- res/ and rules/ are two empty folder filled during the process (you need to create them)

# Working
- Add your misp token in configuration.py
- (explain how it is working)

# TODO
- Modify all different types to simple one for simplify the matching part
