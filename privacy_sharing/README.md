# Privacy Preserving Sharing in MISP

Nowadays, in computer security, we need more than simple malware detectors or anti-viruses. 
New security threats suddenly appear and we have to react as soon as possible. 
This is why a new kind of security levels appeared and is called threat sharing.

The idea behind is to share a threat when we discover one, we allow then,
every other member of the sharing organization to defend themselves against it 
but also to put in common all information they have. This results in fast recoveries 
and protections.

A lot of sharing platforms emerged from this idea. One of them is called MISP,
Malware Information Sharing Platform and Threat Sharing [2]. 
One of its specificities is of being an open source project [1]. 
We can also find a set of tools on the same repository [2].

This platform is maintained by the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL [3])
which is one of the companies helping me in my work. The second one is Conostix [4] 
which provides security and system services in Luxembourg.

IOCs are commonly considered as sensitive data. This induces companies with confidential data to be
unwilling to share IOCs. Especially when in some case, a user needs to have these IOCs on a file that
he can bring with him to check a computer.

Nevertheless, they have no problems to share data if, the user already knows it. 
Which means that a user that has seen the IOC on his computer could be able to discover 
that another organization have seen it and then, to get back information they have, but never otherwise.

And this is on this specific challenge that we are attemding to find a solution.
